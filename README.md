# Moved to Github

I long hosted Sapphire on my own server using SVN.  I no longer used SVN for anything and I wanted to shutdown the SVN repositories on my server but I don't want Sapphire's source to be lost to time.  So I did a quick SVN->GIT conversion of the repositories and moved them here to Github.  I didn't bother with converting the authors from the SVN usernames (which were local to my server) to name/emails.

## Building
I've not built Sapphire in a long time and the process of this conversion is no exception.  It was designed for a much older version of OS X than is current so it may no longer build anymore.  If you want to attempt to build Sapphire, you will need to setup a development environment for [1st Gen AppleTV development](http://wiki.awkwardtv.org/wiki/Main_Page).  Good luck.
