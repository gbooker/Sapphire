Since changing the schema is a bit of a pain, here are the items to add to the next schema.

Code is present but commented out with //AAA:
	Add movieSortTitle to XMLData

Add an NSDictionary to every object to allow these changes to be made immediately and then made properties in the future.
Change translations (and importers to match):
	TV and Movies (not posters):
		showPath and IMDBLink or renamed to url and become full URLs
		Add identifier for importer used
		Add id for movie/series (tt#### for IMDB, numeric for for tvrage)
	Movies:
		IMPLink is removed

Ideas:
Add watched/favorite keys to directories, movies, episodes, and virtual directories
	change watched/favorite to use sets of strings, to accommodate multiple users.
Add a date-added field to files so sorting by date-added can be done
