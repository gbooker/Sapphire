Since changing the schema is a bit of a pain, here are the items to add to the next schema.

Code is present but commented out with //AAA:
Add movieSortTitle to XMLData
Add an NSDictionary to every object to allow these changes to be made immediately and then made properties in the future.

Ideas:
Add watched/favorite keys to directories, movies, episodes, and virtual directories
	change watched/favorite to use sets of strings, to accommodate multiple users.
Add a date-added field to files so sorting by date-added can be done
